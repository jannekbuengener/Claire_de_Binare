# Git Worktree Configuration

This repository is configured to create worktrees in a centralized location.

## Location
All worktrees are stored in: `D:\Dev\Workspaces\Worktrees\.worktrees\Claire_de_Binare\`

## Usage

### Create a new worktree (recommended)
```bash
git wt-add <branch-name>
```

This automatically creates the worktree in the correct location.

**Example:**
```bash
git wt-add feature/my-new-feature
```
Creates worktree at: `D:\Dev\Workspaces\Worktrees\.worktrees\Claire_de_Binare\feature/my-new-feature`

### Manual worktree creation (not recommended)
If you need to create a worktree manually:
```bash
git worktree add "D:/Dev/Workspaces/Worktrees/.worktrees/Claire_de_Binare/<branch-name>" <branch-name>
```

## List all worktrees
```bash
git worktree list
```

## Remove a worktree
```bash
git worktree remove <branch-name>
# or
git worktree remove "D:/Dev/Workspaces/Worktrees/.worktrees/Claire_de_Binare/<branch-name>"
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Centralized location for all worktrees
- ✅ Keeps main repository clean
- ✅ Easy to backup/manage all worktrees together
- ✅ No accidental commits of worktree files to the repository

## Configuration
The git alias is configured in `.git/config`:
```ini
[alias]
    wt-add = !f() { git worktree add "D:/Dev/Workspaces/Worktrees/.worktrees/Claire_de_Binare/$1" "$1"; }; f
```

## Note
The `.worktrees_backup/` directory is ignored in `.gitignore` (line 149) to prevent accidental commits.
