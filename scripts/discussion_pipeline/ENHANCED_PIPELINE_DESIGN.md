## 🚀 **Enhanced Pipeline Phases**

### **Phase 1: Individual Deep Analysis**
Each agent performs specialized analysis:
```powershell
foreach ($Agent in $ActiveAgents) {
    $Analysis = Invoke-AgentAnalysis -Agent $Agent -Topic $Topic
    # Enhanced prompting with conflict encouragement
    # Deeper domain-specific analysis
    # Confidence scoring and uncertainty quantification
}
```

### **Phase 2: Cross-Validation & Conflict Generation**
Systematic disagreement generation:
```powershell  
$Conflicts = Find-AgentConflicts -Analyses $InitialAnalyses -Mode "encourage"
# Pairwise agent comparison
# Conflict severity scoring
# Disagreement pattern analysis
```

### **Phase 3: Iterative Refinement**
Agents respond to challenges:
```powershell
for ($Iteration = 1; $Iteration -le 3; $Iteration++) {
    $RefinedAnalyses = Invoke-IterativeRefinement -Conflicts $Conflicts
    # Agents address specific challenges
    # Evidence strengthening
    # Position refinement or defense
}
```

### **Phase 4: Consensus Building**
Democratic synthesis process:
```powershell
$Consensus = Build-EnhancedConsensus -RefinedAnalyses $RefinedAnalyses
# Identify areas of agreement
# Document persistent disagreements  
# Synthesize hybrid solutions
# Democratic recommendation weighting
```

### **Phase 5: Enhanced Reporting**
Comprehensive analysis documentation:
```powershell
Generate-EnhancedReport -Synthesis $Consensus -Conflicts $Conflicts
# Multi-perspective executive summary
# Conflict analysis and resolution tracking
# Implementation roadmap with risk assessment
# Future discussion topic recommendations
```

---

## 📊 **Advanced Quality Metrics**

### **Consensus Quality Score:**
```
Consensus Score = (Agreement Areas × 0.4) + (Resolved Conflicts × 0.3) + 
                  (Evidence Strength × 0.2) + (Implementation Feasibility × 0.1)
```

### **Conflict Quality Assessment:**
- **Productive Conflicts:** Lead to better solutions
- **Surface Conflicts:** Reveal hidden assumptions  
- **Resolution Quality:** How well conflicts are addressed
- **Evidence Escalation:** Quality of supporting evidence

### **Discussion Health Metrics:**
- **Participation Balance:** All agents contribute meaningfully
- **Perspective Diversity:** Wide range of viewpoints represented
- **Refinement Quality:** Iterative improvement measurement
- **Synthesis Coherence:** Final output logical consistency
