# Claire de Binare

Welcome to the Claire de Binare repository. This project is a complex system for algorithmic trading, featuring a microservices-based architecture, advanced data analysis, and a sophisticated governance model.

## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary components to run and develop Claire de Binare, including:

- **Microservices:** A suite of services for handling different aspects of the trading process, such as signal generation, execution, risk management, and data persistence.
- **Infrastructure:** Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for setting up the required environment, including database schemas, monitoring dashboards, and deployment configurations.
- **Governance:** A comprehensive set of documents defining the project's constitution, policies, and operational guidelines.
- **Tooling:** A collection of scripts and tools to aid in development, deployment, and maintenance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Docker and Python installed. The `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory defines the services required for local development.

For more information about the project structure, see the documentation in the Docs Hub repository.
